# maya_tools
These are just a few of my tools. Please note that I will be regularly updating and adding new tools here. Feel free to use them whenever they are available.

# How to use them.
Simply download and move the files to your corresponding Maya folders, typically found at C:\Users\User\Documents\maya\2022\prefs.

# Upgrading.
 Currently, there are only three tools available, as I am in the process of cleaning up and updating the scripts.
